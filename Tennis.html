<h1>Tennis is cool</h1>

<p>Tennis is a realy easy sport to learn. </p>

<h2>History of tennis</h3>
    <p>the history of tennis is realy close to Batmentan </p>
	<p>Between	1859 and 1865 Harry Gem, a solicitor and his friend Augurio Perera developed a game that combined
	elements of racquets and the Basque ball game pelota, which they played on Perera's croquet lawn in Birmingham in England. In 1872, along with two local doctors, they founded the world's first tennis club on Avenue Road, Leamington Spa.[12] This is where "lawn tennis" was used as a name of activity by a club for the first time. After Leamington, the second club to take up the game of lawn tennis appears to have been the Edgbaston Archery and Croquet Society, also in Birmingham.

In Tennis: A Cultural History, Heiner Gillmeister reveals that on December 8, 1874, British army officer Walter
 Clopton Wingfield wrote to Harry Gem, commenting that he (Wingfield) had been experimenting with his version of lawn tennis “for a year 
 and a half”. In December 1873, Wingfield designed and patented a game which he called sphairistikè (Greek: σφαιριστική, meaning "ball
 -playing"), and was soon known simply as "sticky" – for the amusement of guests at a garden party on his friend's estate of Nantclwyd Hall, 
 in Llanelidan, Wales. According to R. D. C. Evans, turfgrass agronomist, "Sports historians all agre
 e that [Wingfield] deserves much of the credit for the development of modern tennis." According 
 to Honor Godfrey, museum curator at Wimbledon, Wingfield "popularized this game enormously. He produced
 a boxed set which included a net, poles, rackets, balls for playing the game – and most importantly 
 you had his rules. He was absolutely terrific at marketing and he sent his game all over the world. 
 He had very good connections with the clergy, the law profession, and the aristocracy and he sent 
 thousands of sets out in the first year or so, in 1874." The world's oldest annual tennis tournament 
 took place at Leamington Lawn Tennis Club in Birmingham in 1874. This was three years before the 
 All England Lawn Tennis and Croquet Club would hold its first championships at Wimbledon, in 1877. The 
 first Championships culminated in a significant debate on how to standardise the rules. </p>
